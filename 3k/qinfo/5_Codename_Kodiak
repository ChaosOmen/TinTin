 5. Codename: Kodiak:
 Incoming message from : Commander Ford, Command bunker 296-4497.
 I regret to say this will be my last transmission.  Our supplies
 are depleted and our forces torn to shreds.  We continue to fight
 this unseen horror but each day more of our best and brightest
 fall.  My only hope is to protect anyone passing within reach of
 this planet.
 A Renegade Mechwarrior from Clan Ghost Bear has landed on our
 planet and has been slowly tearing us apart.  Our best mechwarriors
 have gone to face the renegade and all have died.  I fear all hope
 is lost.
