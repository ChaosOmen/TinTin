 1. Marbles:
     The Great Marble Quest
 Peeron has wandered Three Kingdoms since its most rudimentary days.
 In this time, he has witnessed many great wonders of creation and imparted
 a bit of his self into nearly every land imaginable.  Unfortunately,
 he exceeded his intellectual capacity to give and, as a result, is
 quite insane.  For months now, fellow wizards have whispered about
 how Peeron has lost his marbles.  Those who would call Peeron 'friend'
 now ask that you lend a hand in revitalizing his sanity.  Hundreds of
 marbles lie strewn about the land of Three Kingdoms.  Your quest
 is to discover their hidden locations and return them to Peeron's
 marble castle located in the plains of fantasy.  For each successfully
 recovered marble, you will receive a one quest point bonus.  Each
 type of marble can only be returned once by a single player.  No
 marbles will exist in 'obvious' locations; discovery will require effort
 on the part of the adventurer.  For Peeron's sanity, we wish you the
 best of luck.
